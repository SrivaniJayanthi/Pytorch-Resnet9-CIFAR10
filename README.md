# Pytorch-Resnet9-CIFAR10
ResNet-9, a lightweight convolutional neural network, was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch, achieving 90% validation accuracy. CIFAR-10, a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, was preprocessed with normalization and data augmentation techniques like random cropping and flipping to enhance generalization.<br>
